					<h3 class="major">Step 1: Read, read, and read!</h3>
					<p>Please make sure to read through the entire website so you won't miss out on important
						information!</p>

					<h3 class="major">Step 2: Submit an application form.</h3>
					<p>Be sure to answer all questions fully. As for detail, we have no issue with long applications.
						Detailed answers will increase your chances of being accepted. Write to your heart's content.
					</p>

					<section class="features">
						<article>
							<h3 class="major">Important: </h3>
							<p>Make sure that you are a member of the Genesis Realm Discord Server. This is required to
								complete the rest of the application process and for easy communication with the Mod
								Team.</p>

						</article>
					</section>

					<h3 class="major">Step 3: Notify the Mod Team that you have submitted your application form</h3>
					<p>Type the command <code>t!selfroles remove</code> in applicant_lounge then,
						choose the role "Hasn't Applied" from the menu that appears. <br>
						<i>You will not be considered as a recruit without completing this step!</i>
					</p>

					<h3 class="major">Step 4: Post build pictures!</h3>
					<p>We'd love to see any of your builds, projects (can be redstone projects or farms!), survival
						bases, or any of your Minecraft accomplishments to get to know more about you as a player.</p>

					<h3 class="major">Step 5: Say hello!</h3>
					<p>We would love to get to know a bit more about you! This is only possible if you chat with us
						every now and then.</p>

						A few reminders before you fill out your application form!
						<div style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%;">
							<li>
								Submitting a form does not mean you will be accepted <br>
								The Mod Team reviews all of our applications carefully. Please understand that we may
								deny your application if we do not see you as a fit in our community or if you have not
								seen our entire procedure through.
							</li>

							<li>
								Good things are worth waiting for <br> Our procedure is lengthy and can be tedious (1-3
								weeks). We believe it to be necessary so that our hard work can remain safe, and also so
								that our recruits can be well-integrated into our community even before being invited
								onto the realm.

							</li>

							<li>
								Clarifications about the form <br>
								If you are confused about any of the questions on our application form, there is
								additional information about them which you can view by:
								<p style="margin-left:5%">
									<br>For those on PC - Hovering over the text box
									<br>For those on Mobile - Tapping on the question
								</p>
