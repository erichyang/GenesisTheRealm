					<h3 class="major">Step 1: Read, read, and read!</h3>
					<p>Please make sure to read through the entire website so you won't miss out on important
						information!</p>

					<h3 class="major">Step 2: Submit an application form.</h3>
					<p>Be sure to answer all questions fully. As for detail, we have no issue with long applications.
						Detailed answers will increase your chances of being accepted. Write to your heart's content.
					</p>

					<section class="features">
						<article>
							<h3 class="major">Important: </h3>
							<p>Make sure that you are a member of the Genesis Realm Discord Server. This is required to
								complete the rest of the application process and for easy communication with the Mod
								Team.</p>
							<a href="https://discord.gg/UVvfVnNRPJ" class="special">Discord Server</a>
						</article>
					</section>

					<h3 class="major">Step 3: Notify the Mod Team that you have submitted your application form</h3>
					<p>Type the command <code>t!selfroles remove</code> in applicant_lounge then,
						choose the role "Hasn't Applied" from the menu that appears. <br>
						<i>You will not be considered as a recruit without completing this step!</i>
					</p>

					<h3 class="major">Step 4: Post build pictures!</h3>
					<p>We'd love to see any of your builds, projects (can be redstone projects or farms!), survival
						bases, or any of your Minecraft accomplishments to get to know more about you as a player.</p>

					<h3 class="major">Step 5: Say hello!</h3>
					<p>We would love to get to know a bit more about you! This is only possible if you chat with us
						every now and then.</p>

					<h3 class="major">Rules</h3>
					<p>
						Genesis cannot thrive without its ground rules. Here are a few of them worth mentioning:
						<div style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%;">
							<li>
							Respect all nouns.
							This means respecting all persons, places, things, and ideas.
							</li>
							<li>
							No griefing, theft, or other actions with malicious intent.
							</li>
							<li>
							No cheating.
							Don't use glitches, exploits, mods, or 3rd party tools such as toolbox to get illegitimate items. Knockback 100 sounds cool, but cheating itself ain't. 
							</li>
							<li>
							No PVP unless agreed upon.
							</li>
							<li>
							No advertisement.
							</li>
							<li>
							Golden Rule: Just don't be a waffle twat and have common sense.
							This realm has always had one mission: to provide a fun and enjoyable Minecraft 
							Realms experience. Please don't ruin that experience for anyone else on here. 
							</li>

						A few reminders before you fill out your application form
					</h3>
					<p>
						<div style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%;">
							<li>
								Submitting a form does not mean you will be accepted <br>
								The Mod Team reviews all of our applications carefully. Please understand that we may
								deny your application if we do not see you as a fit in our community or if you have not
								seen our entire procedure through.
							</li>

							<li>
								Good things are worth waiting for <br> Our procedure is lengthy and can be tedious (1-3
								weeks). We believe it to be necessary so that our hard work can remain safe, and also so
								that our recruits can be well-integrated into our community even before being invited
								onto the realm.

							</li>

							<li>
								Clarifications about the form <br>
								If you are confused about any of the questions on our application form, there is
								additional information about them which you can view by:
								<p style="margin-left:5%">
									<br>For those on PC - Hovering over the text box
									<br>For those on Mobile - Tapping on the question
								</p>

						Acceptance Process
					</h3>
					<p>
						<div style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%;">
						<li>
							The Mod Team reviews applications of recruits in batches. Please be patient and wait for yours to be reviewed.
						</li>
						<li>
							If your application form is considered, you will be notified and given the role <code>applicant</code> and will be able to view the rest of our server and meet the rest of our members. Please note that this does not mean you are fully accepted. This is stage 2 of your application and is a test to see how you fare with the rest.
						
							And also, as a bonus step of our application, add in the word "Unity" anywhere in your form.
						</li>
						<li>
							Once an applicant, you can explore our different channels and chat with the rest of our members while waiting for your final verdict. Please note that you are required to reach the <code>Freshly Spawned</code> role before you can become a full-fledged member. You can receive this role through chatting and gaining server EXP.
						</li>
						<li>
							After some time, the Mod Team will make a final decision based on your performance throughout your entire application and if approved, you will be notified and given the role <code>member</code>. You will also be invited onto the realm!
