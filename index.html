						<p>
						Genesis is a survival bedrock realm founded in June of 2016. Our realm features pure vanilla
						gameplay on hard difficulty, with achievements enabled!
						<br> <br>
						We're a tight-knit community of players from all over the world, each with their own play style,
						interests, and strengths. We value community and collaboration, creativity, and respect. Genesis
						has had setbacks and challenges over the years, but we meet those challenges head-on and
						continue to evolve and improve to the best of our ability. We're fun, goofy, and a family-like
						group who really enjoy playing Minecraft together!

						<h2 class="major">THE GENESIS CULTURE</h3>
							Genesis has always been a community-first realm. Our group thrives off of collaboration and unity. Members are often eager to set up community locations and build public structures and farms to be enjoyed by the entire group. Some even like to share resources with others without asking for anything in return. Genesis would not be possible if it were not for the kindness, hard work and initiative of all our members who love this realm and community!

								June 26, 2016 - July 1, 2016
								<br><br>
								There are no pictures available for this season as the world file could no longer be revisited. 
								Season 1 was also the shortest of the seasons, only lasting a few days due to glitches and destructive players. 
								It was a rough start and a learning experience for the members and management to come.
